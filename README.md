# Income Classification using MLP

## Overview
This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify income levels. It leverages TensorFlow/Keras to build and train the model, applying essential data preprocessing techniques like normalization and categorical encoding. 

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes numerical features, and encodes categorical variables.
- **MLP Model Construction:** Defines a multi-layer feedforward neural network with activation functions and dropout for regularization.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Trains the model using categorical cross-entropy loss and evaluates accuracy, precision, and loss curves.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the MLP model and tune hyperparameters.
3. Evaluate performance using accuracy and loss plots.
4. Use the trained model for predictions.

## Results
The model achieves a good classification performance, distinguishing income levels effectively based on various demographic features.
